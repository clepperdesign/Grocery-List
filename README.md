# Grocery-List
After much trial and error I got a working grocery list program that lets you view and edit a grocery list saved to your computer.
You can add and remove items from the list and it updates perfectly now, without duplicating items, adding weird spacing, or importing 
weird binary /x00 thingies. Why was it adding thingies?? I still don't know. But they're gone.

Go forth and get your grocery on
